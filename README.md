# Student Exam Score Prediction 📚

This project aims to predict students' exam scores based on various academic, social, and personal features using a machine learning regression model.

## 📌 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Hours Studied
- Attendance
- Sleep Hours
- Previous Scores
- Family Income
- Internet Access
- Extracurricular Activities
- Motivation Level
- and more...

## 🧠 Model
A **Linear Regression** model was used for prediction.  
Model was trained on encoded and normalized data.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional visualization)

## 📈 Results
Performance Metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.45
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 3.25
- **R² Score:** 0.77

The model explains approximately 77% of the variance in the exam scores.
